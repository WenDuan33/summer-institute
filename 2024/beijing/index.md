From July 1 to July 12, 2024, State Key Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience and Learning at Beijing Normal University, along with the Psychometrics Center at the University of Cambridge and Microsoft Research Asia will sponsor the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science, to be held virtually at Beijing Normal University of China. The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and beginning faculty interested in computational social science. The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived).

The instructional program will involve lectures, group problem sets, and participant-led research projects. There will also be outside speakers who conduct computational social science research in a variety of settings, such as academia, industry, and government. Topics covered include text as data, website scraping, digital field experiments, machine learning, and ethics. There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.

Participation is restricted to graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and early career faculty. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. About 25 participants will be invited, and participants are expected to fully attend and participate in the entire two-week program. This event is free of charge. The participants are expected to cover their own travel and accommodation expenses during this event. But we will provide 300 RMB per day*12 days merit-based scholarships for up to 10 participants.

[Application materials](https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/2024/beijing/apply) are due 11:59 pm on May 6, 2024 (Beijing time).
